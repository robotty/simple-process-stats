//! A small library to get memory usage and elapsed CPU time.
//!
//! * Supports Windows, Linux and macOS.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use simple_process_stats::ProcessStats;
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! let process_stats = ProcessStats::get().expect("could not get stats for running process");
//! println!("{:?}", process_stats);
//! // ProcessStats {
//! //     cpu_time_user: 421.875ms,
//! //     cpu_time_kernel: 102.332ms,
//! //     memory_usage_bytes: 3420160,
//! // }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! On Linux, this library reads `/proc/self/stat` and uses the `sysconf` libc function.
//!
//! On Windows, the library uses `GetCurrentProcess` combined with `GetProcessTimes` and `K32GetProcessMemoryInfo`.
//!
//! On macOS, this library uses `proc_pidinfo` from `libproc` (and current process ID is determined via `libc`).
